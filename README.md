# The Elder Scrobz

## üéµ About

The Elder Scrobz is a music tracking application that helps you monitor and analyze your listening habits. Inspired by services like Last.fm, Maloja & Listen Brainz it allows you to "scrobble" (track) the music you listen to and provides detailed statistics and insights about your music taste.

**This is a work in progress and not usable at the moment !**

- **Artist & Album Details**: Explore detailed information about artists and albums you've listened to
- **Track Insights**: Get insights about individual tracks in your listening history
- **Data Import**: Import your listening history from other services (Maloja, Last.FM, ListenBrainz)
- **Multi-User Support**: Manage multiple user profiles
- **MusicBrainz Integration**: Enriched metadata from the MusicBrainz database

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **Backend**: Rust with Axum web framework
- **Frontend**: Vue.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **API Documentation**: Swagger UI via Utoipa
